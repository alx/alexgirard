title: A Mashup a day keeps the boredom away
---

Bakc on Twitter after a few months, and on reblog ideas after a few years, I wanted to experiment a small mashup to follow 25C3 conference using flickr for the pictures and twitter for the news.

It was not long to find a Sinatra project using the Flickr API: "flickr-downloader":http://github.com/foca/flickr-downloader/tree from "foca":http://foca.tumblr.com/ ad re-adapt it to fecth vairous information from Flickr and send them to the "TwitPic API":http://twitpic.com/api/.

The result:

!/images/twitpic.png!

It's downloadable and clonable on github: "Flickr Twit":http://github.com/alx/flickr-downloader/

It's just and experiment for the weekend, but it surely can be useful in recent world events that have primarely happened on twitter: London-Mumba√Ø terrorist attacks, big concert at X-Y site, weddings for a day... or to follow a group of flickr artists inside a twitter feed.

Thanks to Noah to have made "TwitPic":http://twitpic.com what it has become.
