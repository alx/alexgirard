p(meta). 21 Dec 2008 - Toulouse

2 years ago, I was visiting Christine in Berlin for Christmas, and it was a surprise to discover than the CCC was doing its "23rd conference":https://events.ccc.de/congress/2006-static/static/2/3/r/23rd_Chaos_Communication_Congress_7c1f.html at the same time, it has always been a hacker group orbiting in my sphere of ideas ("Blinkenlights":http://www.blinkenlights.net/, ...). Since then, I've followed most of their events (and other hacker conferences too: "HOPE"http://www.thelasthope.org/, "What The Hack":http://whatthehack.org/, "DEFCON":http://www.defcon.org/, ...) online and in real life (CCC Summer Camp 2007), it's still the main gate to catch a lot of technical and sociological essays on the net.
