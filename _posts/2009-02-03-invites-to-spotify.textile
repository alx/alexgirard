For those interested, please leave a comment to get an invite on "Spotify.com":http://spotify.com.

It's nothing particular, just a simple iTunes, with a monthly subscription for those who wants to pay, an old music-business concept that some guys have finally put in place.

Thanks to years of music industry battle, we've got this old technology quietly moving in, and it worries me a bit that it'll stll be controlled more by business-spirit than creating a sharing community. On their blog, they've already announced they plan to block some tracks depending on the geographic region, nice way to crash.

Test it, it's simple, you might like it, but it's nothing compared to something like "last.fm":http://last.fm.
If only there was a subscription (and a better music player) on last.fm, they'd win them all.
