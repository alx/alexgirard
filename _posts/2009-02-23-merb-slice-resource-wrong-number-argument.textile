When using resources in a Merb Slice, you can get this kind of error.
I still don't know the core of the problem, but I've found how to solve it.

It begins with the signature of the resource contoller method:

<pre><code>
  # POST /pages
  def create(page)
    @page = Webbastic::Page.new(page)
	.....
</code></pre>

Someway, the *page* object doesn't pass through - number of argument equals 0 - but you can still access to your parameters with *params* object, modifying the method this way:

<pre><code>
  # POST /pages
  def create
    @page = Webbastic::Page.new(params[:page])
	.....
</code></pre>
	
I've post a ticket on Merb dashboard, so this might have another official solution soon: "ticket #1225":http://merb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7433-merb/tickets/1225-merb-slice-and-resources-wrong-number-of-arguments
