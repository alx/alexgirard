title: Deploy a Merb Slice with Rake and Capistrano

h1. {{ page.title }}

On the Slice side, you just need to install the code locally to retrieve the assets, and push the code on your Git repository to retrieve it on your production server.

<pre>
<code>
sudo rake install
git push
</code>
</pre>

On the Merb App side, you'll need to tell it to update the Slice gemon the server first.
For this, I've made a special task in *config/deploy.rb*:

<pre>
<code>
namespace :gems do

desc "Update and install media_rocket gem"
	task :media_rocket do
		run "cd #{gems_path}/media_rocket/; git pull"
		sudo "echo" # Allows to run next command as root
		run "cd #{gems_path}/media_rocket/ && sudo rake install"
	end

end	
</code>
</pre>

Then you'll need to copy the assets from your Slice to your current application, add the changes to Git and deploy it:

<pre>
<code>
rake slices:media_rocket:copy_assets
git commit -a -m "add last asset from media_rocket"
git push
cap deploy
</code>
</pre>
