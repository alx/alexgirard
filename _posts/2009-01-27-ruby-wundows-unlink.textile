title: Ruby and Windows, stupid trick to delete a file
---

Sometimes, you've to be strong enough to delete a "_permission denied_" file under windows with ruby:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/53396.js"></script>

It doesn't take too long, but that's the kind of stupid trick you can avoid if you choose another platform to make your code.
